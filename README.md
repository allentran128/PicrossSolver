# Piccross Solver
We aim to implement a game of Picross in Python 3. Then we will then implement a solver.

## TODO
1. Figure out how we will input a game of Picross
2. Find an API to draw the board
3. Define the controls to play the game 
4. Devise an algorithm to solve the game for a small board.
